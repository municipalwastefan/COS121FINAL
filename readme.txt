CSV File Reader

This file reading program takes a csv file (with 6 columns) designated by user input and allows the user to perform a variety of commands on it.
The program reformats the data into a list of dictionaries, each representing a line of csv data. The user is able to view the
data, search through the data, and add and remove lines of data. If they make changes, they are prompted to save the edited data
as a new csv file. 
To use the program, you run main.py, and follow the prompts in the terminal.
